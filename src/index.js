// Some though about this project

// I want to develop a data fetching skill
// previosly I try create a news API
// but it doens't work
// data just wan't load
// then I recap some of my react and JS knoledge
// And after that I came to conclusion
// that I need finaly start build a little application
// with less ambition
// Because previosly I always was demolished but apps
// I try to build, with some fight I overcame anxiety
//  andprocrastination and finish those simple projects
// (simple if I watch them from now,
// before that they was scary as hell)

// Now we create little weather API which will
// fetch data from some source API
// and display it on our screen by fancy way
// And we will use React Hook's, why?
// Because they are cool and class component
// are difficult to reuse

// For that puurpose we need to do
// yes build another TOD list but with comments

//TODO list:
// 1. Build basic components as App which will
// recive all other component // Deal with it
// 2. Bild simple component which will recive data
// first we test swapi.io API on that
// little cute component, then we change it
// to be better suitable for our goals
// 3. Build custom Hook which will be fetch data
// this dute will be universal as much as
// I can do it
// after we test our custom hook on prepared component
// then watch point 2
// 4. Create other component. I describe them in
// detail in theyer files in comments
// 5. Style all this stuff BECAUSE IT MUST BE COOL
// That it for now recap this though it need
// GO WORK... CHOP CHOP
